# pgzfs-demo

A demo of how to Postgres works when backed by ZFS.

Run the steps one at a time using "sh -x":

	sh 0.sh
	sh 1.sh
	...etc...

Each step describes what it is doing.

If you want to run all of them without reading how they work
(useful for development, but not very pedagogical) run ./all.sh.
